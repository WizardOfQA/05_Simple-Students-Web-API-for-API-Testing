### Roadmap for Selenium UI Test Automation Series:
1> Selenium_UI_Automation Without POM - Manily Focus on Selenium API Functionalities  
2> Selenium_UI_Automation With POM - The Structure and Creating of POM  
3> Selenium_UI_Automation With Logging and Reporting Functionalities.(Extent Report) - How to Logging and Reporting using Extent Reports in a Selenium framework     
**4> Selenium_UI_Automation With Behavior Driven Development(BDD) Using Specflow - How to implment BDD to the framework using Specflow**

I might add more series as needed to showcase UI Automation with Selenium.  

## Specflow
### Some Advantages of Using Specflow
* Collaboration. Even without programming skill, anybody can write the test.
* Everybody is in the same page. Developers, Automation Testers, Manual Testers, Business Analyst, Managers etc.
* Feature files that contain scenarios become living documents. 
* Reduces code duplication.
* It automatically gives QA acceptance criteria.
 
## Sameple Test Cases Covered:
### Orbitz.com
* sf_User_Can_Search_Vacation_Rental
* sf_User_Can_Search_Rental_Car_With_Advanced_Options
